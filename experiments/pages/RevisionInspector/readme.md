# Revision Inspector
## Description
Sometimes you need more information about previous page revisions than the App Composer provides, or you want to look into previous revisions quickly without having to restore each one individually. This tool allows you to look at the revision history for live pages without having to make changes to the pages that may disrupt other users.

This page allows you to
- View revisions for any page in your org
- Compare the XML between revisions
- Copy a revision's XML at the click of a button

## Caveats
This page is good for quickly inspecting page revisions in a single environment. See [https://docs.skuid.com/latest/en/skuid/cicd/](https://docs.skuid.com/latest/en/skuid/cicd/) for development and deployment best practices.

This page works in the Skuid managed package on the Salesforce environment.

## Future Improvement
- Add the ability to search the revision XML (must use SOSL Search)
- Add features to pretty print the XML
- Create a version of this page for the Skuid Platform
